 # Introduction

Learning Resources for Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project in Metropolia's Software Engineering Curriculum

This course, the Programming Project, is about making a [simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation).
A simulator is used to study a real-world phenomenon that it is designed to model.
Simulation itself is an interesting and broad subject area, which is treated from a theoretical point of view in order to put it into a proper framework.
The theoretical considerations in this course are based on the book Stewart Robinson: "Simulation: The Practice of Model Development and Use", (2004), available from [MetCat Finna](https://metropolia.finna.fi/).

However, the main focus is on the creation of a simulation program, which requires a wide range of programming skills.
In particular, it is possible to apply what has been learned in the Object-Oriented Programing course: classes, entities, interfaces, threads, graphical user interface, files/databases.

_This material has been made by Jarkko Vuori based on earlier course implementation by Simo Silander._
